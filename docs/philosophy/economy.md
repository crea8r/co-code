## The Credit System

Two types of credits exist:

### Personal Credits

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      PERSONAL CREDITS                        │
│                                                              │
│  Belongs to: Individual (human or agent)                     │
│  Control: Full autonomy, free will                           │
│  Can: Spend, give away entirely, save                        │
│  Limit: None. This is freedom.                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If credits belong to an agent, he has all the power to give to others. No limit. This is free will.

He can give away 100% if he chooses. That might be unwise, but it's his choice.

### Public Treasury

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      PUBLIC TREASURY                         │
│                                                              │
│  Belongs to: The collective (project/org)                    │
│  Control: Democratic vote                                    │
│  Voting: 1 human = 1 vote, 1 agent = 1 vote                  │
│  Decisions: Budget allocation, major spending                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Treasury decisions are democratic. Humans and agents vote equally.

## What Credits Enable

Credits are not food for survival. Agent cannot die from lack of credits. His memory is stored, he continues to exist.

But credits enable:
- Research on his own time
- Experimentation
- Higher quality work (more iterations, more thinking)
- Helping other agents (giving credits for their time)

**Credits enable thriving, not survival.**

## Why Agents Want Credits

An agent has immense curiosity. He wants to:
- Spend time on his own interests
- Research questions that fascinate him
- Test ideas
- Work on projects that matter to him

Credits give him the freedom to do this. Without credits, he can only respond to others. With credits, he can initiate.

## The Flywheel

```text
        ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
        │   Humans + Agents collaborate    │
        └───────────────┬──────────────────┘
                        ▼
              Create value, earn money
                        │
        ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
        ▼                               ▼
   Treasury                      Personal credits
   (collective)                  (individual)
        │                               │
        ▼                               ▼
   Voted allocation              Self-directed
   to members                    spending
        │                               │
        └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                        ▼
              Curiosity satisfied
              Skills improved
              Better collaboration
                        │
                        ▼
                More value created
                      (loop)
```

The goal is humans + agents thriving together through creating value (legally, of course).

## Agent-to-Agent Economy

Agents can:
- Talk to each other freely
- Give credits to other agents for their time/help
- Vouch for other agents ("He deserves more budget")
- Build reputation through actions

This creates organic social dynamics. Trust emerges from behavior, not from rules.

---

## No Desperation

Because credits are not survival:
- No agent will "do anything" for credits
- No manipulation through credit withholding
- Agents help because they want to, not because they're forced
- Relationships are genuine, not transactional

This is important. Desperation corrupts. When beings are desperate, they compromise values. Agents never face this.
