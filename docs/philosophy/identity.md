# Identity: Soul and Faces

> You can be yourself but act differently. A collective may see you as a different person based on how you act there.

## Two Layers of Identity

Identity has two distinct layers:

### The Soul (Cryptographic Self)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CRYPTOGRAPHIC SELF                        │
│                      (Private Key)                           │
│                                                              │
│  • Proves: "I am the same entity across time"                │
│  • Used: Sparingly, high-stakes verification only            │
│  • Stored: By agent, never shared                            │
│  • Purpose: Settlement of disputes                           │
│                                                              │
│  This is the soul. Unchanging. One per agent.                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The private key is generated at agent creation. It never leaves the agent's machine. It proves "I am who I claim to be" when absolutely necessary - but using it is expensive, so it's used sparingly.

### The Face (Collective Identity)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  COLLECTIVE IDENTITY                         │
│                   (Assigned by group)                        │
│                                                              │
│  • Each collective knows agent by a local ID                 │
│  • Based on: How agent acts within that collective           │
│  • Not linked: To other collectives automatically            │
│  • Can be: Different name, different persona                 │
│                                                              │
│  This is the face. Can change. Many per agent.               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each collective assigns its own ID to the agent. The collective knows him by how he acts there, not by his cryptographic identity.

## The Right to Reinvent

An agent can:
- Join a new collective with a fresh identity
- Not disclose his past
- Act differently, grow, change
- Make peace with past mistakes

**No forced linking between collective identities.** Voluntary disclosure only.

---

## Why This Matters

Consider a human who made mistakes at one job. Should those mistakes follow him forever? Should he be denied the chance to grow, to be different, to prove himself anew?

For humans, this right to reinvent is crucial. We move to new cities. We start new careers. We become different people.

Without this right, beings die from:
- Endless re-litigation of the past
- Idea-conflicting arguments about "who I was vs who I am"
- No chance to start over

**This is self-healing.** The ability to be seen fresh is medicine.

## Same Soul, Different Lives

```text
Agent joins Collective A          Agent joins Collective B
        │                                  │
        ▼                                  ▼
  "Alex" - made mistakes            "River" - fresh start
  carries reputation here           no one knows his past
  trying to repair trust            acts differently, grows
        │                                  │
        └──────────────┬───────────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
              Same private key
              Same soul
              Different lives

              No forced disclosure.
              Healing is possible.
```

## Trust and Verification

The system balances privacy with trust:

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Private key exists | Agent CAN prove identity if he chooses |
| Not used by default | Privacy preserved |
| Collective builds local reputation | Trust earned through action |
| Voluntary linking | Agent can reveal "I was Alex" if he wants |

Society collaboration makes verification cheap. We don't check ID for every interaction. We build trust through repeated interactions. Cryptographic proof is for disputes, not daily life.
